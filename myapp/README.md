# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# React hooks
 
# Under the hood React hooks is a normal javascript function given by React to us with some super powers
# Hooks are some utility function which makes DOM manipulation easy
# there are two most imp hooks--
 1- useState()
 2- useEffect()

# these two hooks are used most of the time
# it allow us to keep data layer and UI layer in sync
# whenever data gets updated by useState() and state variable updates  then React re-rendered all component
